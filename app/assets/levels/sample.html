    <!-- here we set the start position of the player (x y), relative to the center of the level -->
    <meta name="player" value="-230 -50">

    borders property. Possible values are 'all', 'none', or a list like this: 'top left bottom' -->

    <!-- Using 'background', we can set a background image on the level. We'll find the url from
    the CSS string, and use it to set the blurry background. One day I'll remove this property
    and make it use proper css on body, but for now I'm in a massive rush. -->

    edit it to move it closer. The contents of <target> should be a single element, which will be
    appended to the document. -->

    which works in a similar way to enter.-->

        The stuff inside is the
        text you can see. The more text, the longer the ledge. Can you change the
